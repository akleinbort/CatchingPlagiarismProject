However, within the confines of that chaos, something intriguing occasionally occurs: A seemingly mundane detail about the world will suddenly become more interesting, having been viewed from a slightly different perspective than usual.

This sort of miniature epiphany is called a showerthought.

If you’ve ever realized that “Wet Paint” signs probably cause more stained fingertips than wet paint does on its own, you’ve had a showerthought. If you’ve ever noticed that human hair is technically a renewable resource, you’ve had a showerthought. These sorts of musings tend to arise while a person’s mind is engaged with a routine, uncomplicated activity (like commuting, mowing the lawn, or waiting for a customer service representative to finally answer their allegedly important telephone call), and while the word “showerthought” may be a bit misleading – showerthoughts don’t have to occur in the shower, after all – the concept it embodies is something which everyone has experienced.

However, within the confines of that chaos, something intriguing occasionally occurs: A seemingly mundane detail about the world will suddenly become more interesting, having been viewed from a slightly different perspective than usual.

This sort of miniature epiphany is called a showerthought.

If you’ve ever realized that “Wet Paint” signs probably cause more stained fingertips than wet paint does on its own, you’ve had a showerthought. If you’ve ever noticed that human hair is technically a renewable resource, you’ve had a showerthought. These sorts of musings tend to arise while a person’s mind is engaged with a routine, uncomplicated activity (like commuting, mowing the lawn, or waiting for a customer service representative to finally answer their allegedly important telephone call), and while the word “showerthought” may be a bit misleading – showerthoughts don’t have to occur in the shower, after all – the concept it embodies is something which everyone has experienced.
